To execute each code one should run everycells and uncomment some of the cells to unplot some graphs. 
Be warry about the size of the fitness evaluation for each algorithm when you plot a graph, you may have to ajust some of the values.
For the neural networks please add the dataset in the repository to run the code for each of the cases.
